# Biography

I am a computational social scientist at The Work Innovation Lab by Asana, where I lead collaborative intelligence. We're developing cutting edge tools for improving how collaboration happens in the workplace. In my previous role, I was an assistant professor at Stanford University, where I taught computational social science and social network analysis.
