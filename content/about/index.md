Mark is a PhD candidate at Columbia University and a fellow at INCITE.
His research uses advanced quantitative methodologies in the social sciences -
including social network analysis, fMRI, and machine learning - to understand the
interrelation between social structure, culture and cognition. In particular, he
is interested in how methods from social cognitive neuroscience can help sociologists
understand how relational stimuli and relational information are encoded at
the  level of the brain and whether they can help clarify how social structure
affects individual perception, cognition and behavior. His advisor is Peter S. Bearman.
