# Biography

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Sociology at Columbia University. Using novel combinations of network analysis and text analysis, I study the dynamics of cultural contention and the role that ideas play in the formation of groups and institutions. My dissertation analyzes the reading habits of New York and American elites following the American Revolution to understand the concerns and interests of elite factions as they vied for political and economic power. I hold a BA in Social Research and Public Policy from NYU Abu Dhabi.
